This project is a Python game where you play Hand Cricket against the computer. First, you bat and score runs by choosing numbers from 1 to 6, while the computer bowls with random numbers. If both numbers match, you are out. Then the computer bats, and you bowl by choosing numbers. If the numbers match, the computer is out. The target for the computer is your score +1. Finally, the program compares both scores and declares the winner or a tie.
